## Running locally

<i>This site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)</i>

```bash
npm ci # Or 'npm i', but this is faster & no package-lock.json re-write
```

Then run in development mode (recommended for dev work):

```bash

```

Then open the site at http://localhost:3000
